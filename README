Meaning of 3 numbers on each line: confirmed deaths recovered

The county names follow the iso3166 convention (from python3's iso3166 lib). For each country, there're 3 levels at most.
  Level1: Country, starts with 2 dashes
  Level2: Province/State, starts with 4 dashes
  Level3: City/County, starts with 6 dashes

  For example:
  -- Canada    33    0    6
  ---- ON    20    0    3
  ------ Toronto    19    0    2

For USA only, there's 5-digit code following the county name which is the FIPS county code to uniquely identify an US county.
  For example: 
  ------ Los Angeles(06037)    7    0    0
